## Specification

Your task is to implement **stack** and **queue** class with **double-ended queue**. Before that, you need to implement the double-ended queue with doubly linked list. Each node of the doubly linked list holds the element, the previous and the next node.

Successful implementation of **a TODO will result in 5 points**, and **all 18 TODOs will result in 100 points**. 

Note that *poor code style and poor performance* can result in lower scores, even if all TODOs are done.

## Submission

**Deadline**: **In class (100) or 28 Sep 2020, 23:59 (60)**. Any uploads after 28 Sep 2020 23:59 will get  **ZERO** point.

Create a zip file named **StudentID-StudentName-Lab02.zip** that contains your code project and upload your zip file to **https://wss.pet/s/3k786jn71d4 (password: 6006)** . Enter **StudentName** in the *Your Name* field.
